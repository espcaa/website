Numworks is a cool brand of calculators and I have one!
Making your software personalized is quite fun so I tried to adapt the open source
[epsilon software](https://github.com/numworks/epsilon) with some cool stuff following the [doc on it](https://www.numworks.com/engineering/software/build/) \
At that time the doc wasn't up to date so I had to figure out things by myself! Here's some info if you want to do the same :)

## Getting started

1) Fork the epsilon repo! (Numworks license specifies you shouldn't redistribute it modified, but github tos should still allow you to make a fork?)
2) Clone and install the dependencies as specified in the doc **BUT MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE USING arm-none-eabi-gcc 12.2.1** (some other versions might work too, but the default one on a lot of linux distros won't work)
3) Make some modifications! \
 *try modifying the colors in `/escher/include/escher/palette.h`*
4) Now you just have to compile it for your calculator.

For a n0120 (the most common one):
```bash
make clean
make -j10 userland.B.dfu MODEL=n0120 TARGET=device.n0120
```
(if you need to build for a N0115, jut change the args, and just remove them for a N0110)
(you might need to build the A userland if running `python3 build/device/dfu.py -l | grep '0x90000000'` returns something, just build the B one if it doesn't)

5) Flash it to your calculator! \
For an A userland:
```bash
python3 build/device/dfu.py -s 0x90010000:leave -D output/release/device/n0110/userland/userland.A.dfu
```
For a B userland:
```bash
python3 build/device/dfu.py -s 0x90410000:leave -D output/release/device/n0120/userland/userland.B.dfu
```

## Github action!

I made a github action that does all of this for you if you want :) \
