I made this little devboard for fun when i was in sf! I wanted a small rp2350 board and thought why not add mechanical switches to it! After a while i found a cool reverse design thanks to [acon's attempt at this](https://aconlin.com). I spent a lot of time on this since it was my first really complex design; i was just used to drop capacitors resistors and mcus on boards before!\
\
I was so determined to make it that i spent a full night fixing everything and even working on it at the laundromat!\
\
yay looks cool :p

]}/>

I was so scared it wouldn't work but still ordered it from jlcpcb! (50$, not that bad actually...)\
After a few weeks it arrived and to my surprise, everything worked perfectly the first time! I then soldered the switches & headers and i had a complete project :D
\
\
look how pretty it is :D
