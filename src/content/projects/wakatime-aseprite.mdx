Wakatime aseprite is a little extensions that I made to help people track their time on it, mainly for [hackclub](https://hackclub.com) events!)
It's really simple and just relies on wakatime-cli to send and cache all the heartbeats.

I made it in a few hours so it's not perfect but it works quite well for me + it helped a lot of people so i'm quite proud of it :D
